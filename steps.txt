1. Create a New SSH Key
# We need to generate a unique SSH key for our second GitHub account.

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<your-email-address>"

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/yetao/.ssh/id_rsa):

>> /Users/yetao/.ssh/id_rsa_work

Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): <passphrase>


---------------------
2. Attach the New Key
cat /Users/yetao/.ssh/id_rsa_work.pub and then copy the ssh key

Goto https://github.com/settings/keys and attach your copied ssh key


---------------------
3. Add the SSH Key to the Agent
Next, because we saved our key with a unique name, we need to tell SSH about it. In the Terminal, type: ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work. If successful, you'll see a response of Identity Added.

$ ssh-add Users/yetao/.ssh/id_rsa_work
Enter passphrase for /home/vaati/.ssh/id_rsa_work: 
Identity added: /home/vaati/.ssh/id_rsa_work (dummy85@gmail.com)

-------------------------
4. Create a Config File
$ touch ~/.ssh/config

and add follwing: 

```
Host github.com-work
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work
```

Now remember 

$ git remote add origin git@github.com-work:JansonYeTao/test_ssh.git
$ git push origin main
